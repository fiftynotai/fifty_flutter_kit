# Task: Create Briefs for fifty_tokens Package Implementation

You are **igris**, the AI development assistant for the fifty.dev ecosystem.

## Context Files

Read these design system files in the project to understand the full scope:
- `fifty_design_system.md` - Complete design language specification
- `fifty_brand_sheet.md` - Visual brand reference
- `fifty_ecosystem_map.md` - Package ecosystem map
- `fifty_package_roadmap.md` - Development strategy

## Your Mission

Use **your own brief system** to break down the implementation of the **fifty_tokens** package into structured briefs.

## Package Overview

**fifty_tokens** is a zero-dependency Dart/Flutter package containing design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, motion, shadows, radii, breakpoints). It's the foundation layer that all other fifty.dev packages will depend on.

## What Needs to Be Built

1. **Package Structure** - Directory layout, pubspec.yaml, exports
2. **Color Tokens** - Complete crimson palette + surfaces + text + semantic colors
3. **Typography Tokens** - Font families, weights, type scale, spacing, line heights
4. **Spacing Tokens** - 8px-based spacing scale
5. **Motion Tokens** - Animation durations and easing curves
6. **Radius Tokens** - Border radius values and BorderRadius objects
7. **Elevation Tokens** - BoxShadow definitions (ambient, glow, focus)
8. **Breakpoint Tokens** - Responsive breakpoints and gutters
9. **Test Suite** - Validation tests for all token values
10. **Documentation** - README and code documentation

## Technical Requirements

- **Zero external dependencies** (Flutter SDK only)
- **All values must match the design system exactly** (precision is critical)
- **Pure constants** (no logic, no state, just static const values)
- **All tests must pass** (`flutter test`)
- **Zero linter warnings** (`flutter analyze`)
- **Professional documentation**

## Design System Key Values Reference

**Colors:** Crimson Core `#960E29`, Tech Crimson `#B31337`, Surface0 `#0E0E0F`, etc.
**Typography:** Space Grotesk (display), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (code)
**Spacing:** 8px base grid (2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48)
**Motion:** 120ms (fast), 180ms (base), 240ms (slow), 280ms (overlay)

*(Full specifications are in the design system files)*

## Your Task

**Use your brief system to:**
1. Analyze the full scope of work
2. Break it down into logical implementation briefs
3. Define dependencies between briefs
4. Structure them for efficient execution
5. Register them in your system

**Do not implement yet** - just create and register the briefs according to your methodology.

## Success Criteria

- All implementation work is covered by briefs
- Briefs follow your system's structure and conventions
- Dependencies are properly mapped
- Ready to execute on command
